# Friendly Frog Fighting

Welcome to **FFF**, the **frog fighting game for friends**!
In this simple browser fighting arena, two frogs (close friends) are fighting to decide who is the strongest in the lake. Pick a side (and a friend of yours) and start fighting for the title.

# Details

This is the first time I tried to build something like this, so I followed **[Chris Courses](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Yp2yz6-pwhQuPlIDV_mjA)**' [JavaScript Fighting Game Tutorial with HTML Canvas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ&ab_channel=ChrisCourses) to start building this.
This game is being made with JS, some HTML elements and the Canvas API. 

# Planning

After creating the basics of the game, I will add some other functionalities:

 - [ ] Background and interface sprites
 - [ ] Player sprites
 - [ ] Main menu
 - [ ] Local multiplayer / AI enemy
 - [ ] Online multiplayer
 - [ ] Multiple characters
 - [ ] Dodge system
 - [ ] Character unique traits
